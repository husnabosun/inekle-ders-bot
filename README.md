# inekle-ders-bot
this project is developed based on  [ Ceren Akyar's ZaraStockChecker project ](https://github.com/CerenAkyr/ZaraStockChecker).

I drew significant inspiration from her codes especially using selenium. So a BIG THANK YOU to her indirect help üôèüôè
This app basically gives a sound notification whenever a lesson is added to the lesson pool by controlling html objects after automatically login to the site (inekle.com) with user informations. This way users can create a demand and increase the chance of being the instructor of the lesson as an early bird üïäÔ∏è
